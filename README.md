## History ##
This portfolio was first built as a personal challenge for me. The progress I have made during the years has been really big and 
since I worked out of the "web page making"-world for a while I came back in 2017 to do this portfolio just show to myself I could do it 
without any help from Twitter Bootsrap or Wordpress. The idea know is to have home for my projects I have been working on since 2014 
to show off for any future employers or recruiters.

## Libraries used ##
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com "jQuery")
* [GreensockJS](http://greensock.com "GreensockJS")
* [.onScreen();](https://silvestreh.github.io/onScreen/ ".onScreen();")

## A special thanks ##
A very special 'thank you' goes to oh so important [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/ "CSS-Tricks") for the "Same page"-scrolling snippet. That was part of the reason why 
I did a one page-template in the first place.
